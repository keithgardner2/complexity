<h1>Rank sort</h1>

<p> This is a pretty simple working algorithm to implement, and as such is usually slow. The concept is pretty easy is understand: you go through each element of your array, and for each item, you compare and see how it ranks it terms of size. You count the number of items smaller. Then, you insert the item into a second array at that index.

<h3>Here's code in c to sort the data in descending order:</h3>

<code>
<pre>
    int spot;
    int copy[problemSize];
    for(int i = 0; i < problemSize; i++){
        spot = 0;
        for(int j = 0 ; j < problemSize; j++){
            if(data[i] < data[j] && data[i] != data[j]){
                spot++;
            }
        }
        copy[spot] = data[i];
    }
</pre>
