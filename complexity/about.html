<h1>So, what's this all about?</h1>
Hi there.  You're probably wondering why someone wrote an app that didn't involve
throwing birds at pigs or crushing candy, so let me explain.  I teach computer science at <a href="http://www.cs.binghamton.edu">SUNY Binghamton</a>,
and normally cover courses on algorithms at the grad and undergrad levels.
<p>
Over the past few years, I've started using an iPad in class, as a way to
project slides and PDFs.  It's also been handy as a replacement for writing on a white
board (particularly when all the white board markers are dried out).  Sometimes I
run things on a remote server using SSH.
I wanted to have a way to demonstrate algorithms, and manipulate some graphs,
so the sensible thing seemed to be to put all of that stuff into an app.  Having
it all on the iPad saves the hassle of jumping back and forth between projecting
the screen, and something out of a book, or wrangling with adapters to
connect to a laptop.  In my spare time, I play around with writing music apps,
so it wasn't a big deal to knock out an app for computational complexity.
After the initial release, I've drafted some of my students to keep tinkering
with things (a big thanks to Keith Gardner, a current undergrad, and Anthony
Canino, a recent MS grad, for all their help).
<p>
In this app, there's a simple graph illustrating Big-O complexity curves
for log n, n, n log n, and n squared, with some sliders to adjust the
constant c, and the problem size.  The take-away from this should be that
the Big-O complexity of an algorithm does in fact matter -- and that as
the problem sizes increase, the run time differences become vast.
<p>
All this Big-O stuff is great on paper, but to really drive the point
home, the app also sorts numbers with different algorithms.
A large set of numbers are generated
at random (no downloads, yay!), and then can sort them using quicksort
or bubble sort.
<p>
For small problem sizes, the choice of algorithm isn't that big of a deal --
and too often, students will only test things on data sets they type
in by hand, which means that the data sets are small.
<p>
Where things get interesting is on the bigger problems.  Run the sorting
algorithms on problems with a hundred elements, and quicksort and
bubble sort will complete in the blink of an eye.  Run the problem size
up to thousands or millions, and the fun starts.  Quicksort is still
fast.  Bubble sort, not so much.
<p>
It's tempting to gloss over the differences between algorithms,
and it's certainly easier to implement the "trivial" approaches, rather
than algorithms that require tricky data structures, recursion, and all
kinds of other scary stuff.  But...  it's worth it.  <b>Big-O complexity
    matters.  It matters a lot.  You can pretty much forget about
cache sizes, clock rates, and even parallelism, if you screw up
the Big-O complexity of your algorithm implementations.</b>
<p>
Anyway, that's what the app is about.  An easy way to integrate some
Big-O complexity graphs, and a few algorithm implementations, into
a computer science course.  I've put the app up in the store so that
students (or anyone else, for that matter) can grab it.  There will
probably be a few updates, where I'll be adding
more algorithms, some write-ups, and whatever else comes to mind.
There might be an embedded mini-game of Angry Bearcats in the future.
We'll see.
<p>
If you've got questions or comments, <a href="mailto:pmadden@acm.org">drop me an email</a>.  If you wind up
using the app as part of a computer science course, that would be fun
for me to know.  You can also say <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/computational-complexity/id788314470?ls=1&mt=8">something nice in the app store if you
like.</a>  I won't send you a hexidecimal dollar, but if you find a bug,
I'd like to hear about that too!
<p>
Have fun with the app, and I hope you find it useful!
