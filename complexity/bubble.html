<h1>Bubble sort</h1>

<p>Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm to implement. As a consequence, bubble sort takes a long time to run if the data is large. This algorithm goes through pairs of data and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, and repeats this until all of the data is sorted.

<p> Average performance: O(n^2)<br>
Worst Case performance: O(n^2)<br>
Best Case performance: O(n)

<h3>Here's the code for a bubblesort in objective-c:</h3>

<code>
    <pre>
    -(void)bubbleSort{
        int i, j;
        for (i = 0; i < problemSize; ++i){
            for (j = i + 1; j < problemSize; ++j){
                if (data[i] > data[j]){
                    int t = data[i];
                    data[i] = data[j];
                    data[j] = t;
                }
            }
        }
    }
</pre>
