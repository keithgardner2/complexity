<h1>Bubble Sort</h1>

<p>Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm to implement. It is also slow as a consequence. Bubble sort goes through pairs of data and swaps them if they are in he wrong order, repeatedly.

<p> Average performace: O(n^2)
Worst Case performace: O(n^2)
Best Case performance: O(n)

<p>Heres the code for a bubblesort in c:

<code>
    <pre>
    -(void)bubbleSort{
        int i, j;
        for (i = 0; i < problemSize; ++i){
            for (j = i + 1; j < problemSize; ++j){
                if (data[i] > data[j]){
                    int t = data[i];
                    data[i] = data[j];
                    data[j] = t;
                }
            }
        }
    }

</pre>
