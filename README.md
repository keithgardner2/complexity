complexity
==========

This project was started by Professor Madden at Binghamton Univeristy, State University of New York, with the goal of helping students study Algorithms. Over winter 2014 and into spring 2014 I worked on putting the app on iPhone and expanding the types of sorts the app could demonstrate. We open sourced it to get other students around the University started on iOS, while also learning about algorithms.

I hope to expand this app to include data structures, which go hand in hand with algorithms and would make the app an even better tool for CS students.
